# Introduction
This is basically a summary of how I've been improving my English ability in my life.

# 0 to 12 years old (Born to Elementary school)
No expose to the language at all. 

# 13 to 16 years old(Middle school to High school junior year)
 In middle school, English was one of the mandatory subjects and I hated it. Naturally, I sucked at it.
I still remember the time I made my mom so shocked because I couldn't spell the word 'really'. Looking back on it now, I don't know why I couldn't spell the word but for some reason, the word seemed like the most complicated word in the world to me back then. My mother forced me to join a cram school after that.

# 17 years old(Highschool senior year)
 In my country, College is a big deal. They say your whole life depends on it. I didn't think so but I saw a chance of getting out of my `nothing ever happens` type of hometown.
So I decided to study insanely hard to get into a good college as if my life had actually depended on it.
English, of course, was one of the subjects in the examination. I still kind of had this preconception of me never being good at the subject when I first started studying it for the college exam.
 But regardless of how I think about English, getting a very high score on English test was absolutely crucial to get into my, so called, dream college. 
Ironically,  I got 196 out of 200 which was the highest score of all the subjects in the examination I took. The nearly perfect score I got on English helped me a lot to get into a very prestigious college that I didn't even dream of getting into. 
 Although devoting more than 10 hours of every day into studying for roughly a year was indescribably stressful, I was really happy to get into the college and I became a bit confident in my English ability.
 At this point, I think I liked English as a subject but not necessarily as a language.

# 18 to 19 (College freshman)
 On the first day of college, we had an introduction about classes and stuff. And, to my surprise, taking an English test was scheduled right after the introduction. At that time, my brain was preoccupied with which club I'm going to join, which parties I'm going to that day and so on. So I decided to sleep through the whole test.  Of course, I got a very very bad score. 
What I'm trying to say here is that I didn't care about English at all at this point. All I cared about was some stuff all college kids care about like what clothes to wear, how to attract girls and stuff.

# 20 (College sophomore)
 After I became a sophomore, I started thinking about what I'm going to do after college. The first thing popped up in my mind was becoming a government official. To become a government official, you have to pass some tests. So I decided to go to this specialized school to study for the exams and did an internship at a city councilor's office. The reason I did the internship was that I thought it would look cool on my resume when I take interviews for becoming a government official. During the internship, I met this other college kid who was like one or two years older than me and did backpacking in southeast Asia for like a year.  At that time, I didn't even know what backpacking was and couldn't even imagine what it's like to do something like that. But for some reason, all the stories he told me intrigued me a lot.

 After studying for the exams for about a month, I realized it's not for me. Memorizing all the articles of the constitution and learning about legal stuff was just incredibly tedious to me and I also realized I didn't really want to become a government official. So I quite the school(of course not my uni. it's the school for the exams) even though I had already paid all the tuition which was approximately  $5000. Luckily it was not my parent's money. It was from my student loan which I'm paying back myself.
At this point, It's safe to say I was pretty lost in my life lol. It was actually really hard for me to discover what I really want to do in my life. I think it's because everything I had to do in my life up until college was very simple and clear. I just had to do what people told me to do like doing well at school, going to a cram school, playing baseball and stuff. I literally was not capable of figuring out what "I" want to do or what "I" want to become. I was just walking on a rail that was set up for me. 

 I didn't like the idea of not being able to think for myself at all and wanted to do something about it. I remember I seriously pondered about my future and things I actually want to do in my life for like a couple of weeks. I thought about becoming a lawyer, politician, accountant and so on. Those professions are very respected in our society and having one of those professions basically assures my financial stability and social status for the rest of my life. I think I tried to force myself to believe "I" actually want to do one of those things but It didn't work. None of them excited me at all like not even a bit. 

 On the other hand, what seemed really exciting and interesting was doing backpacking just like the guy I did the internship with did. At that time, I was still a sophomore and thought "yeah why the heck not?? I still got some time. I'd start worrying about my future after this trip!!:):):) gotta live my life a little!:)". I believe it was February or March when I left my country for Thailand for backpacking for a month. 

It was like 2am in the morning when I got to the airport in Thailand. And then, I realized how dumb this whole this was. I was in a foreign country alone without any plans or people I can count on. I was genuinely terrified. However, the trip turned out to be great mainly because of the very nice and kind people I met there. Due to the help of those people, I ended up going to many great places in Thailand and I even went to Cambodia during the trip.
