## How to use the cli you created

```
// Run build 
$ go build main.go
// Move it under /usr/local/bin
$ cp my-cli /usr/local/bin
// Check if it's working
$ my-cli -y "Hello"
```

or 
```
// Install our command to the $GOPATH/bin directory:
$ go install
// Check if it's working
$ my-cli -y "Hello"
```
