# Rudimental SQL

## Retrieviing records from one table.

### ■ Retrieve data from a column of a table.

```sql
SELECT column_name FROM table_name;
```
### ■ Retrieve data from multiple columns of a table.

```sql
SELECT column_name1, column_name2 FROM table_name;
```
### ■ Make an alias and retrieve data from the column of the table.

```sql
SELECT column_name AS alias FROM table_name;
```
```sql
SELECT column_name1 AS alias1, column_name2 AS alias2 FROM table_name;
```
### ■ Cliculate data and retrieve.

```sql
SELECT column_name * 10 FROM table_name;
```
```sql
SELECT column_name * 10 AS alias FROM table_name;
```
### ■ Concat strings and retrieve.

```sql
SELECT column_name || 'string' FROM table_name;
```
```sql
SELECT 'string'||column_name AS alias FROM table_name;
```

### ■ Retrieve the average number of a column.

```sql
SELECT AVG(column_name) FROM table_name;
```

```sql
SELECT AVG(column_name * 3) FROM table_name;
```

### ■ Search records conditionally (WHERE).

```sql
SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
```sql
SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE column_name = 'record';
```
```sql
SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE column_name > 2;
```
```sql
SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE column_name LIKE '%string'
```

__Comparison operators__

|Operator|Example|Meanning|
|---|---|---|
|=|x = y|Returns true when x and y are equal.|
|<>|x <> y|Returns true when x and y are not equal.| 
|<|x < y|Returns true when x is less than y.|
|<=|x < y|Returns true when x is less than or equal to y.|
|>|x > y|Returns true when x is more than y.|
|IN|x IN y|Returns true when x is in y.|
|NOT IN|x NOT IN y|Returns true when x is not in y.|
|BETWEEN|z BETWEEN x AND y|Returns true when z is in between x and y.|
|NOT BETWEEN|z NOT BETWEEN x AND y|Returns true when z is not in between x and y.|
|LIKE|x LIKE y|Returns true when x matchs the y pattern.|
|NOT LIKE|x NOT LIKE y|Returns true when x does not match the y pattern.|
|IS NULL|x IS NULL|Returns true when x is null.|
|IS NOT NULL|x IS NOT NULL|Returns true when x is not null.|

### ■ Search records conditionally(CASE~WHEN)
```sql
SELECT column_name,CASE WHEN condition THEN 'string' ELSE 'string' END FROM table_name;
```

### ■ Retrive records by group.
The `COUNT(column_name)` function shows the number of colums of the column.
`COUNT(*)` includes null coluns, `COUNT(column_name)` excludes null columns.

```sql
SELECT column_name, COUNT(*) FROM table_name GROUP BY column_name;
```
```sql
SELECT column_name, COUNT(*) FROM table_name GROUP BY column_name HAVING condition;
```
```sql
SELECT column_name1, column_name2 COUNT(*) FROM table_name GROUP BY column_name1, column_name2;
```

### ■ Sort and Retrive records.

```sql
SELECT column_name FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name;
```
### ■ Retrive unique records.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT column_name FROM table_name;
```

## Interacting with multiple tables.
You can specify which table's column you are refering to by using the syntax below.
```
table_name.column_name
```

### ■ Sql subquery syntax.

```sql
SELECT column_name1 
 FROM table_name1 
WHERE value IN (SELECT column_name2 
                FROM table_name2 
                WHERE condition);
```
### ■ INNER JOIN.
(INNER) JOIN: Select records that have matching values in both tables.

```sql
SELECT column_names
  FROM table_name1 JOIN table_name2 
    ON column_name1 = column_name2
 WHERE condition
```
### ■ LEFT OUTER JOIN.
 Select records from the first (left-most) table with matching right table records.

```sql
SELECT column-names
  FROM table-name1 LEFT JOIN table-name2 
    ON column-name1 = column-name2
 WHERE condition
```
### ■ RIGHT OUTER JOIN.
Select records from the second (right-most) table with matching left table records.

```sql
SELECT column-names
  FROM table-name1 RIGHT JOIN table-name2 
    ON column-name1 = column-name2
 WHERE condition
```
